# Deploy Hugging Face Models on Google GKE Autopilot

This repo contains a ML serving framework for deploying [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/models) on Google GKE Autopilot. 

[GKE Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview) is a mode of operation in GKE in which Google manages your cluster configuration, including your nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings. Autopilot clusters are optimized to run most production workloads, and provision compute resources based on your Kubernetes manifests.
